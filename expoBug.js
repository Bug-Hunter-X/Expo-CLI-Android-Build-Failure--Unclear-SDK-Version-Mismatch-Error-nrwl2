This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Android SDK version specified in your project's `gradle.properties` file and the version installed on your system. Expo CLI relies on the Android SDK to build and run Android apps. If the versions don't match, it leads to build failures.  The error message itself might not be very clear, often pointing to a general build problem rather than the specific SDK version conflict.  Example gradle.properties file:
```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
#This is the line that might cause a mismatch
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk
```
